# CST-201
Group Project for CST-201
The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to: Create a game like battleship using pattern matching while integrating Christian values in the design and teamwork process.

Write a program based on a version of brute-force pattern matching for playing a game like Battleship on the computer, incorporating principles of fairness, respect, and perseverance drawn from Christian teachings. The rules of the game are as follows:
•    There are two opponents in the game (in this case, a human player, and the computer). 
•    The game is played on two identical boards (10 × 10 tables of cells) on which each opponent places his or her ships, not seen by the opponent. 
•    Each player has three ships, each of which occupies a certain number of cells on the board: a destroyer (a two-by-two square of cells), a submarine (three diagonal cells either from left to right or right to left), a cruiser (three consecutive cells either horizontal or vertical). 
•    No two ships are over each other.
•    The game is played by the opponents taking turns “shooting” at each other’s ships. 
•    The result of every shot is displayed as either a hit or a miss. 
o    In case of a hit, the player gets to go again and keeps playing until missing.
•    The goal is to sink all the opponent’s ships before the opponent succeeds in doing it first.
•    To sink a ship, all cells occupied by the ship must be hit. 
Your program should start by allowing the player to set all their ships (see the game rules) and the program will set its own ships randomly following the rules.
The player is asked to indicate a position on the table and if it hits, it will say hit and ask to select another position and if it misses, it will say miss and the program will take a turn and display a random cell and follows the rules of the game.
Note: The players should not be allowed to select a repeated cell or one that is not in the table. If so, they will be given an appropriate message and asked to select another cell.

Submit your pseudo code, your source code, and create a Loom video in which you run your program and offer a brief explanation of the logic for your program. Your video should not exceed 4 minutes in length. As part of the video submission, each member of the team is required to submit an explanation of their part in the assignment, the way they communicated, their function as a member of the team, and how Christian values shaped their teamwork.

Use Loom to upload your completed video and ensure that your instructor can access and view your private, linked video prior to submitting it to the digital classroom.

This assignment uses a rubric. Please review the rubric prior to beginning the assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.
